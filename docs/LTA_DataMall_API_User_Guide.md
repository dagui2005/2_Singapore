1. MAKING API CALLS

API calls need to be made programmatically in regular intervals to obtain the constant stream
of data for your respective development or research needs. For illustration purposes, the API
call below is being made via a third-party application – Postman.

Steps to making an API call:

1. Download and install the Postman from https://www.getpostman.com/. Fire it up!
2. Make sure Https method is set to GET.
3. Enter the URL (refer to subsequent pages in this document) in the field request URL.
4. Enter your AccountKey under Headers.
5. (OPTIONAL STEP) The “accept” header allows you to specify the response format of
your API call. Default is JSON. Specify “application/atom+xml” for XML.
6. Click on the Send button.

Figure 2-1

Figure 2-2 below shows the JSON response of an API call made for the Traffic Incidents dataset.

Figure 2-2: API (JSON) Response as shown on Postman.

With the exception of the following Bus Arrival API listed below (see Table 1), API responses
returned are limited to 500 records of the dataset per call. This number may be adjusted from
time to time.

To retrieve subsequent records of the dataset, you need to append the $skip operator to the
(501st 1000th),
API call (URL). For example, to retrieve the next 500 records to the the API call
should be:
https://datamall2.mytransport.sg/ltaodataservice/BusRoutes?$skip=500

To retrieve the following set of 500 records, append ‘?$skip=1000’, and so on. Just remember,
each URL call returns only a max of 500 records!

Table 1: API Response Size

|  | API |  |  | Response Size |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bus Arrival |  |  | Not Applicable. Depends on parameter supplied. |  |  |
| Train Service Alerts |  |  | Not Applicable. Depends on the scenario. |  |  |
| Passenger Volume related |  |  | Returns one record per request. |  |  |
| Taxi Stands |  |  | Not Applicable. Dataset is too small. |  |  |


Following is a guide on how you can generate sample code snippets from Postman.

1. After setting up on Postman to make an API call as per the steps in Figure 2-1, select
the code icon </> in the right panel of the Postman application.

Figure 2-3

2. Use the dropdown list to select the code snippet in the desired programming language.

Figure 2-4

3. Code snippet will be automatically generated in the chosen programming language.

ADVISEMENT ON FRONT-END IMPLEMENTATION (BUS APPS)

1. [EstimatedArrival] Display of Advisement Messages when there is NO Bus Arrival Data

In the event where data is not available (be it in partial or in full) on the API, you may want to display
some form of ‘status texts’ to advise your app users on what’s going on, as far as bus service
availability is concerned. To do this, you will need to take reference from two data points – (1) the
presence or absence of Arrival data itself, and (2) the bus service operating hours at each bus
stop which you need to obtain via the Bus Routes API.

With those two data points gathered, you will arrive at the following possible scenarios:

For scenarios (b) and (c), you may display advisement messages like those suggested in the table
above, or any other user-friendly and appropriate variants at your discretion.

Next, you should note that Arrival data may be available on the API even when bus services are
supposedly NOT in operation (as per scheduled operating hours) – reflected as scenario (d) in the
table above. This happens,

a. before first bus(es) begin their service from Bus Interchanges / Depots in the mornings, and,
b. when last bus(es) at night are running behind schedule; slightly past operating hours.

Therefore, the general logic to be applied, is to always first display the Arrival data if it’s available
on the API, irrespective of the scheduled operating hours. Advisement messages like “No Est.
Available” and “Not In Operation” are applicable ONLY when there is no Arrival data on the API.

| # |  |  | Operation Status |  |  | Data Availability |  |  | Advisement Message |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a. |  |  | Bus is in operation |  |  | Arrival data is available |  |  | (none required) |  |  |
|  | b. |  |  | Bus is in operation |  |  | Arrival data is NOT available |  |  | “No Est. Available” |  |
|  | c. |  |  | Bus is NOT in operation |  |  | Arrival data is NOT available |  |  | “Not In Operation” |  |
| d. |  |  | Bus is NOT in operation |  |  | Arrival data is available |  |  | (none required) |  |  |


2. [EstimatedArrival] Rounding of Seconds

All derived bus arrival duration should be rounded down to the nearest minute.

Derived duration: 3:49 mins
Display duration: “3 min”

Derived duration: 2:07 mins
Display duration: “2 min”

Derived duration: 1:59 mins
Display duration: “1 min”

Derived duration: 0:59 mins
Display duration: “Arr”

3. [Load] Colour Scheme Adoption

You may adopt this colour scheme to serve as visual indicators for the various loading values:

- [Green] Seats Available
- [Amber] Standing Available
- [Red] Limited Standing

You are given the flexibility for the manner in which you display the colours, i.e. colour bars, coloured
timings, and accompanied with legends where appropriate and/or necessary.

4. [Feature] Wheelchair Accessible Buses

You are given the flexibility to display any symbols or labels to denote oncoming buses that
are wheelchair accessible.

5. [Feature] Schedule Indicator

You are given the flexibility to display any symbols or labels to indicate if the bus arriving
times are based on the schedule from operators and may be subject to changes.


ADDITIONAL NOTE ON LOOP SERVICES THAT RUNS BOTH DIRECTIONS

Please note that some Loop Services are appended with ‘G’ or ‘W’ to denote their direction of travel.
You should account for and display these services individually – 225G, 225W, 243G, 243W, 410G, 410W.
